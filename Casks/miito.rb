  caveats <<~EOS
    Miito is ad-hoc signed and not yet notarised, so Gatekeeper blocks the first
    launch. Clear the quarantine flag once, and it will open normally after that:

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Miito.app

    Notarised builds will not need this at all.

    This build points at https://dev.cypressai.co. To point it somewhere else,
    create ~/Library/Application Support/miito-desktop/config.json:

      {"workspaceUrl": "https://app.cypressai.co"}
  EOS
end
